        <p>Wave to Earth was formed when Kim Daniel and Shin Dongkyu were in middle school. They said they formed a band with the ambition of "showing music that makes a new wave." They debuted with the single "wave" on 23 August 2019 with a new member Cha Soonjong. They released two EPs in January 2020: Wave 0.01 and Summer Flows 0.02. They signed with Wavy, the label where Colde is the owner, in 2021. They had a live performance with La Poem on Naver Onstage. In 2023, they released their first studio album, 0.1 Flaws and All. They were included in the lineup of South Korean rock festivals, including the Seoul Jazz Festival and Pentaport Rock Festival, and The Other Festival in Indonesia. Wave To Earth recently completed a sold-out North American tour in September 2023. On September 6, 2024, they released their latest studio album entitled Play with Earth! 0.03.</p>
